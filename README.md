# [Flag Quiz Game]()

For my first milestone project, I had to build a static responsive front end website as part of my Diploma Course with the Code Institute. I wanted to build a game of some kind.  I was watching a old episode of Big Bang Theory and Sheldon was doing Fun With Flags and it give me the idea to do a quiz game for my project.

# UX

## Strategy

The idea for this web base game was to build a fun quiz game that all ages could play.  To take the world flag's and see how much of you world the player knows.

## Goals

#### The design of the game:

As the designer of this game I wanted to build a simple and clean looking design.  A user friendly interface than any player of any age could just start playing. As this is my first project in Javascript, I wanted to start to understand how javascript works without overwhelming myself with to much complex and detailed procedures. I want to provide a enjoyable and stimulating game that the player/players would want to play again and again.

#### Design Goals:

 - A fun and easy to play game that all ages can play.
 - To be able to education the players as they play the game.
 - To be able to play the game multipe times and still be challenged.
 - To have a player want to play again to better his/her score.
 - Build something I am proud of.
 - To understand and use affectively the knowledge for the course.

#### User:

    - First time player
        - Easy to understand how to play the game and how to navigate throught the game.
        - Something that is fun and look good to  play.
        - Something to challenge them without overwhelm them at the same time.

    - Returning players
        - To be challenge even after playing the game a few times.
        - I improve his/her scores on the leaderboard.
        - To eductional themself to the country flags.
