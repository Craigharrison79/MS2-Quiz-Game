# [Flag Quiz Game](https://craigharrison79.github.io/MS2-Quiz-Game/)

For my first milestone project, I had to build a static responsive front end website as part of my Diploma Course with the Code Institute. I wanted to build a game of some kind.  I was watching a old episode of Big Bang Theory and Sheldon was doing Fun With Flags and it give me the idea to do a quiz game for my project.

# UX

## Strategy

The idea for this web base game was to build a fun quiz game that all ages could play.  To take the world flag's and see how much of you world the player knows.

## Goals

#### The design of the game:

As the designer of this game I wanted to build a simple and clean looking design.  A user friendly interface than any player of any age could just start playing. As this is my first project in Javascript, I wanted to start to understand how javascript works without overwhelming myself with to much complex and detailed procedures. I want to provide a enjoyable and stimulating game that the player/players would want to play again and again.

#### Design Goals:

 - A fun and easy to play game that all ages can play.
 - To be able to education the players as they play the game.
 - To be able to play the game multipe times and still be challenged.
 - To have a player want to play again to better his/her score.
 - Build something I am proud of.
 - To understand and use affectively the knowledge for the course.

#### User:

- First time player
    - Easy to understand how to play the game and how to navigate throught the game.
    - Something that is fun and look good to  play.
    - Something to challenge them without overwhelm them at the same time.

- Returning players
    - To be challenge even after playing the game a few times.
    - I improve his/her scores on the leaderboard.
    - To eductional themself to the country flags.

## Scope

- Responsive interface.
- Simple menu.
- Easy and simple section to find instructions on how to play the game.
- To have a random question asks from at array.
- Display the generate quesiton on the page.
- To generate the right image for each question.
- Have a countdown counter to run down as the player go through each quesiton.
- To have a updateable score which will be shown at the end of the game.
- Indentify the right answer once the player has taken a guess (to help educate the player on the subject).
- To indecate how well the player as done between each game or other players game.
- To restart the game once finish.

## Building Constraints

- Design
    - First time building a game like this.
    - Understand how UX works for web base game.
- Teachnical
    - Just started out with javascript and is new a programing.
    - Time frame alot to build the features needed.
    - The ablitity to research and find the answer to the coding question once the problem show themself.
    
# Design

To build a clear looking game that simple on the eye and that is modern look but will not age.

### Wireframes

I used mockup [mockflow.com](https://www.mockflow.com/) once again to design the idea for the web base game.  Link below to the design.

Or

- [Wireframes Download PDF](https://github.com/Craigharrison79/MS2-Quiz-Game/blob/master/assets/documents/images/flag-game-wireframes.pdf)

### Typography

### Color Scheme

The colour scheme - I wanted to keep the game clean looking and not uses to many colours. The midnight green was a nice starting colour as it's a good dark colour that still pop a little without overwhelming the users eyes.  Orange was a nice pop of colour to give contrast to the  background and also give the user a simple indicator of were to look. The cadet blue is again a nice clean different in colour to help indicate the buttons on the page.

### Image

 - Landing Page the two images are from
    - [undraw](https://undraw.co/illustrations): Around the world but I remove the figure to just have the world in [figma](https://www.figma.com) this was then export to a svg "world.svg".
    - [handz 3D](https://www.handz.design/): A package of different hands that I made into a image also in figma and export it to svg "handz.svg".

# Features

- #### Landing Page or menu

- A clean inviting page to indicate what site/game the user is looking at.
- Two call to action buttons. One of starting the game and a second of the instructions on how to play the game which will show up in a model to help the user with navigation.

- #### Game Page

- First a area to indicate which question the player/user is on.
- The question its self.
- The image to the questions.
- The 4 answer boxes. One of the boxes will indicate the right answer once the player/user has answered the questions. This help educate the player/user.
- The timer which count down show the player/user and time left they have to answer the question.

- #### Score Page

- The player/user overall score for the game.
- A form (input and button) to allow the player/user to enter his/her name so he/she can save the score and maybe be enter to the high score card.
- Buttons: First one to save player/user score once name is enter.  Second to open up the score card table and see who the top player/user are.  And third button to enter back to the landing/menu page.

### Future Features

- To build on the web base game:
    - Adding lot of different array to give the user a differnet subject/question to pick from.
    - The highest score board to be seen by different player on different computer and not just local Storage.
    - Adding a choose of levels, from beginer to pro.
    - Have a battle game to competer against players online.

# Testing

## Testing process can be read [here](assets/documents/testing.md).

- ## Testing User Experience and Stories (UX)

# Deployment

Deployment of the project is on GitHub Pages, this is how I deploy it:

- With the code being done in Gitpod and push to my repository in GitHub.
- Log-in to GitHub and moving to my repository and finding and opening MS2-Quiz-Game.
- Locating and clicking on the settings in the menu bar on the top of the page.
- Scroll down the page till you reach the GitHub Pages section.
- In this section under the source click the dropdown select that read “None” and select master and then save.
- Refresh the page and scroll back down the same section and you find the published link for your site.
